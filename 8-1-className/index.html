      <p>Customer experience management is designing your business around the way customers want to do business. Giving them what they want, when they want it&mdash;wherever they want it. Consistently ranked number one in customer service, T-Mobile is one of the world's leading mobile communications companies. We worked with T-Mobile to arm the company's frontline sales and service representatives with the tools they need to give customers a great experience time after time. Leveraging T-Mobile's existing technology infrastructure, we found a simpler way to access customer information. Our customer experience management solutions helped T-Mobile minimize training and significantly reduce system complexity. Now T-Mobile frontline employees can spend more time with customers and less time with the system&mdash;which all leads to a better customer experience in T-Mobile stores and call centers. As T-Mobile representatives maximize the value of every customer interaction, they transform their customers into loyal brand advocates and get a significant return on investment.</p>
